### Hey there! 👋

I'm Aditya, a self-taught dev and kinesthetic learner who's always building something new ⚡

For the past 2.5+ years, I've been shipping web & onchain apps, advocating for devs and helping grow developer communities 🌍

To share what I’ve learned, we’re building **[Tech Bastic](https://techbastic.github.io)**, an open-source community that helps you become a self-taught developer, where we learn, build, and collaborate 💻

I love creating tech content, hacking at hackathons, connecting with folks in the community, and travelling solo ✈️
