### Hey there! 👋

I'm Aditya, a kinesthetic learner who's always learning and building new things. ⚡

I was always curious about tech gadgets, which led me to code and helped me become a self-taught developer.

To share what I’ve learned, we’re building **[Tech Bastic](https://techbastic.github.io)**, an open-source community that helps you become a self-taught developer, where we learn, build, and grow together. 🤖

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me creating content, connecting with fellow community folks, or travelling solo. 👨‍💻

#### Contact Information 
Want to connect? Shoot me an email at adityasuyashgupta@gmail.com. I’ll get back to you soon! 😉
